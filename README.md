# Dir2DB

A simple Python CLI program that searches a directory for CSV files and inserts that data into a Sqlite database.

If multiple CSVs share the same schema as an already existing table, the data will simply be inserted into that table.


### Usage

Simply run the program in a directory or provide a directory argument.
